Note
-------------------------------

1. The  Breakout Board for ESP32 supports both the  ESP32 and  ESP32S3 boards.Please pay attention to the orientation of the ESP32 board when using it. Inserting itincorrectly or misaligning it couldlead to board damage.
2. The 5V is powered by the DC jack, and it supports a maximum ourput current of 3A. 
3. The S terminal directly connects to the ESP32 board, with a levelrange of 0-3.3V. Most electronic modules in the market apply TTL signals, with some powered by 3.3V and others by 5V. According to the TTL Logic Levels, the range of high level is 2-5V and low ranges from 0 to 0.8V. Therefore, even if a 5V device is used,it can still be driven by the pinsof the S Terminal. However, if level conversion chip is added to the circuit, it will cause malfunction to the 3.3V devices.
4. The power supply of the 3.3V pins depends on whether you connect power supply to USB or DC jack.
5. During use, if the pin is NC, the corresponding LED indicator will light up or go out randomly.
6. If you find that some LEDs are not controlled, please first check whether the pin is an input pin. The LED indicator can only indicate the status of the output.

   :class: red

:red:`The ESP32 breakout board is compatible with a variety of ESP32 series main control boards with different modules. The method to determine whether it is compatible is to compare the number, position （Include the distance between pins in the same row and the distance between pins in different rows） and name of the pins`
